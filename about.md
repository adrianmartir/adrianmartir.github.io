Hello, I'm Adrian! In 2022, I found the AYP website after meditating for most of a night on a flixbus (I couldn't sleep). I quickly got hooked on the online lessons and started reading them intently. Soon I had established my own regular practice. Since then a lot has changed in my life, and it still is in the process of changing. I have found something, that is really worth pursuing, and an effective means of getting there. In October 2024 I successfully completed the AYP teacher training course on Koh Tao. I really hope to be able to pass this wonderful, mind-expanding technique along to others who might be interested. My most influential spiritual teachers have been yogani and Tristan Dorling.
