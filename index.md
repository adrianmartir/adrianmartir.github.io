# What is AYP?

[Advanced yoga practices](aypsite.org) (or AYP) is a spiritual system with *deep meditation* at its core. The second major part of AYP is a breathing technique called *spinal breathing pranayama*. The systematic application of these two has the potential to significantly improve our quality of life.

One aspect of this improvement, is the cultivation of *inner silence* by the practice of deep meditation. In time, we will find a sense of *wholeness* and *unending joy* within us. As a result, we will be much less affected by whatever circumstances we might find ourselves in.

# Who invented AYP?

AYP started as a series of lessons being published on an online forum starting in 2003 by the anonymous American author '*Yogani*'. His aim was to create an *open* spiritual system, without being *sectarian* and *secretive*. Indeed, all the information needed for creating an effective practice is available [online](https://www.aypsite.org/MainDirectory.html).

Yogani calls himself a *spiritual scientist*, having developed his system to be highly effective. He moves away from superstition, strict devotion to guru figures and religion as a prerequisite, while still drawing on millennia of spiritual knowledge.

It is worth noting that most of the first half of yogani's main lessons, is also available on [Tristan Dorling's website](https://www.aypinternational.com/lessons/), with a more modern look. Tristan has been part of the AYP community for many years and regularly runs retreats. He also has been running the AYP teacher training courses the last couple of years.

# Classes

There is a small group meeting online every Thursday at 18:30 CET (for German speakers). Write me an <a href="mailto:{{ site.email | encode_email }}" title="mailto">email</a> if you would like to join!

In the future, I might plan local events either in Hamburg (Germany) or in Barcelona (Spain). I would also love to get in touch with other AYP practitioners in those areas.
